The CS562 project

This is a repository where we will work on our CS562 project!!!

read input file for relevant fields
information schema querying
get code repository


fetch datatypes for a column in a table
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/columns-table.html

using Connector/Net library for database calls
http://zetcode.com/db/mysqlcsharptutorial/

another tutorial explaining individual methods to use for database queries

Left for us to do:
when generating mf_struct code, if its an avg aggregation then generate getter method {if (count == 0) then return 0 else return sum/count}
	could optionally do this in pretty printing
do pretty printing of collections objects at very end
handle NULL case? would have to add a boolean for each possible null object value and check if boolean beforehand
clean up code
test!!!
